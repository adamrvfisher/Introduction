# People involved in time series and risk analysis - traders, risk managers, finance students, etc. may find useful tools here.
# Most apps are built around Yahoo! time series style dataframes; however, the addition of feature columns to the time series are helpful for machine learning.
# To install, download library to working directory, you may choose to run EntityCreation.py to set up a folder heirarcy (input directory location), and then reference directory location and run YahooDataScraper.py - this will populate a local folder directory. Use UniverseList.csv and NASDAQData.csv in YahooDataScraper.py. You may chose to quickstart and just pull data into apps with YahooGrabberII.py.
# HTTP requests from YahooGrabberII.py feed most of the apps data for calculation.
# You will find code from:
# "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists" by Müller and Guido
# "Python for Finance -- Analyze Big Financial Data" by Yves Hilpisch
# "Statistics and Machine Learning in Python" by Duchesnay, Löfstedt, and Younes
# The depths of the internet.
# Life is short, but a repository is forever.
