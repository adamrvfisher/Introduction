# A brief introduction
# I intend to share useful tools with people.
# After an enlightening experience, I have decided to publish all of my library.
# Many of these tools were pioneered by other developers and financial engineers.
# You will find code from:
# "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists" by Müller and Guido
# "Python for Finance -- Analyze Big Financial Data" by Yves Hilpisch
# "Statistics and Machine Learning in Python" by Duchesnay, Löfstedt, and Younes
# Life is short, but a repository is forever.
